							Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m a passionate
							developer with a Bachelor of Science
							in Computer Science, graduating this
							year.
							{/*  I embarked on my coding journey
							back in 2018 and haven&apos;t looked
							back since. Over the years, I&apos;ve
							delved into a variety of languages and
							technologies, including C#, Java, PHP,
							JavaScript, C++, CSS, HTML, React,
							Next.js, MySQL, Tailwind CSS, and
							Node.js. */}
						</p>
						{/* <p>
							I take pride in my perfectionist
							approach to development, ensuring that
							each project I undertake meets the
							highest standards of quality and
							precision. One of my standout
							achievements is the FarmKonek landing
							page, which garnered significant
							attention for its sleek design and
							compelling content.
						</p> */}
						<p>
							While I&apos;m still exploring
							different industries within
							development, I&apos;m always eager to
							learn and grow. I stay updated with
							the latest trends and technologies
							through YouTube tutorials and
							documentation updates, constantly
							seeking ways to expand my knowledge
							and skillset.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to coding, I have a
							passion for photography, travel vlogs,
							and editing. When I&apos;m not
							immersed in lines of code, you can
							often find me capturing moments behind
							the lens, documenting my adventures in
							travel vlogs, or honing my editing
							skills to perfection.
						</p>
						<p>
							I&apos;m excited to continue my
							journey in the world of development
							and explore new opportunities to
							innovate and create. Let&apos;s
							connect and build something amazing
							together!
